
Make a two page app with routing that tries to show some details about a public git repository (no authentication required).
First page shows 2 input fields where you type username and repository name (or just one input that takes {username}/{repositoryname}) and a submit button that takes you to the second page.
Second page shows all the files in the repository as a list of absolute file paths.
If time permits, the contents of the README.md file (if it exists) can be shown below the list.
